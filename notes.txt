# Notes for myself during development

Angular? Web framework that allows teams to deliver powerful and scalable apps with confidence.
Why angular? Focus on tools and productivity 

# CMD commands
ng version ; which angular cli version
ng serve ; starts a local development server usually at 'http://localhost:4200/'
ng generate component home ; creating a new component called home

interfaces in angular are custom data types for the application (basically like classes in cpp)
ng generate interface housinglocation ; command for above

@Input() housingLocation!: HousingLocation; 
the code above and Input() in general, allows components to share data

When adding a property binding to a component tag, we use the [attribute] = "value" syntax to notify Angular that the assigned value should be treated as a property from the component class and not a string value.

The value on the right-hand side is the name of the property from the HomeComponent.

tldr passing data to components and displaying/interpolating them in child template;;;
    in parent component in the export declare an object from the interface
    in the child component use @Input to catch the object and use it freely in ur template using {{ obj.propertyName}}

Angular Services? Angular services provide a way for you to separate Angular app data and functions that can be used by 
    multiple components in your app. To be used by multiple components, a service must be made injectable. 
    Services that are injectable and used by a component become dependencies of that component. 
    The component depends on those services and can't function without them.

ng generate service housing --skip-tests ; generating a service called housing
