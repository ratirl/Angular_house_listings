# Notes for myself during development

Angular? Web framework that allows teams to deliver powerful and scalable apps with confidence.
Why angular? Focus on tools and productivity 

# CMD commands
ng version ; which angular cli version
ng serve ; starts a local development server usually at 'http://localhost:4200/'
ng generate component home ; creating a new component called home

interfaces in angular are custom data types for the application (basically like classes in cpp)
ng generate interface housinglocation ; command for above

@Input() housingLocation!: HousingLocation; 
the code above and Input() in general, allows components to share data
