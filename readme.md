# Angular project of house listings in the USA

Website coded using Angular utilizing concepts commonly used Angular like routing, backend api data fetching,interface classes for Angular objects, input decorators, property binding, interpolating values into a template, forloops with ngFor, services, event handlers.

For the API data fetching I utilized json-server to mimic it locally.
